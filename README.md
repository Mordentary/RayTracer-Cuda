CUDA-Accelerated Ray Tracer
This project is an enhanced version of my basic ray tracer, now accelerated using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). It leverages GPU parallelism to significantly improve rendering performance.
Key features:

CUDA implementation for parallel computation
Improved rendering speed for complex scenes
