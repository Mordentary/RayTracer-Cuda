CUDA-Accelerated Ray Tracer
This project is an enhanced version of my basic ray tracer, now accelerated using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). It leverages GPU parallelism to significantly improve rendering performance.
Key features:

CUDA implementation for parallel computation
Based on my original CPU ray tracer project
Improved rendering speed for complex scenes

This project demonstrates the power of GPU acceleration in computer graphics applications.
